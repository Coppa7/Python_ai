This project contains three Python scripts for performing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using a Random Forest classifier.

## Overview

The scripts explore different approaches to sentiment analysis, including:

1. Basic train-test split and prediction
2. Encoding labels and calculating mean absolute error
3. Using `Pipeline` and cross-validation for evaluation

All scripts use `CountVectorizer` for text feature extraction.
